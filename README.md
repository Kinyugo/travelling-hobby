Hello ðŸ‘‹, today I will be sharing with you how you can make travelling your hobby. Travelling is a great hobby that you can enjoy alone as well as with you loved ones. Here are places you can visit today in [Kenya](https://www.thrillophilia.com/destinations/kenya/places-to-visit).

While travelling, I enjoy doing the following:
- Taking pictures
- Listening to cool classic music like *Evening star by Kenny Rodgers* 
- Telling stories

Here is a list of foodstuffs that I usually interact with while travelling
1. Fried chicken **I am a vegetarian**
2. Soft drinks
3. Any other meal ðŸ˜‹
